# exapix
Example of finding pi digits with a simple tester  
  
To compile example run `g++ example_pix.cpp -o example_pix -std=c++17`

## Tester
Tester runs multithreaded pix on random index intervals and compares with data stored in the file  
  
To compile put your `pix.asm` in this folder and run `./testCompile.sh`  
  
Then run `./test` to test the solution
